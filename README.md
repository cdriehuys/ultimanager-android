# UltiManager

Android client for the [UltiManager API](https://github.com/cdriehuys/ultimanager-api).


## Developer Resources

Here's some resources used while developing the app.

### [Persisting Data in a Database][room-persistence]

Google's official guide to using Room, their wrapper around SQLite. Room simplifies the whole process of setting up databases and tables using Java classes and annotations. TL;DR: Less SQL, more Java.

### [Listing Items from a Database][listing-db-items]

This page describes the entire process going from setting up the models in the database to querying for them and listing them using a `RecyclerView`.
